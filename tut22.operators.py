# Operators in python
# Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Identity, Membership, and, Bitwise

# 1. From Arithmetic operators : Helps in arithmetic calc
# print("5+6 is", 5+6)
# print("5-6 is", 5-6)
# print("5*6 is", 5*6)
# print("5/6 is", 5/6)
# print("5//6 is", 5//6) #rounds up the integer value of the answer
# #this is called floor division operator
# print("5**6 is", 5**6)
# print("5 % 6 is", 5 % 6)

# 2. Assignment operators: used for assigning values to a variable
# x=5
# print(x)
# x+=7 #adds 7 to the value of x
# print(x)
# x%=7 #x = x%7
# print(x)
# x-=7
# print(x)

#3. Comparison operators
# i=5
# print(i==5) #gives false as i is not 5
# print(i != 5) #i not equal to 5
# print(i>5)
# print(i >= 5)

# 4. Logical operators: similar to boolean algebra
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)

# 5. Identity operators: is is not
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)
# print(5 is not 7)
# print(5 is not 5)

# 6. Membership operators:
# list1 = [3, 3, 2,21,23,33,32]
# print(32 in list1)
# print(324 not in list1)

# 7. Bitwise operators:
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11
print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 1) #this | represents OR
#so 00 or 01 is 01 which is 1 in binary
print(0 | 3) #00 or 11 = 11 which is 3 in binary
